# F-Switch (recreation of G-switch)

# the purple balls flying towards the player are powerups which make the player go faster and the rocks are the obstacles that are flying towards the player.

# Obstacles:
#   the game will end with the sad face when the player directly bumps into it or even when the rock is within a close radius to the person, it works both ways.
